To manage stocks for a supermarket

This project deals with creating a code-based solution for stock management in supermarkets. 

This coding helps in:
*Adding the details of the new stock
*Viewing the entered stock details
*Adding the details of stocks sold on a particular day
*Finding the remaining stocks
*Calculating the opening and closing balance of a day
*Calculating the profit and loss of a day.

The coding involves basic structures and for loop concepts which are used to achieve the process of stock management.
Structures to get date and stock details are created.
