(To manage stocks for a supermarket)

This project deals with creating a code-based solution for stock management in supermarkets. 

This coding helps in:
*Adding the details of the new stock
*Viewing the entered stock details
*Adding the details of stocks sold on a particular day
*Finding the remaining stocks
*Calculating the opening and closing balance of a day

The coding involves basic structures and for loop concepts which are used to achieve the process of stock management.
Structures to get date and stock details are created.
A switch case is used to get the choice of the user.
Once the choice is accepted, the corresponding function is called.
This is mentioned in the body of the switch case.
For example,
if the choice is A: then the function stock-entry is called.
if the choice is B: then the function stock-addn is called.
if the choice is C: then the function stock-remaining is called.
if the choice is D: then the function balance-calc is called.
else default block is executed.

The corresponding code for performing the functionalities are described in the function definition.
